Conceicao Rodrigues College of Engineering major Computer Science. There's no particular hobby taht I'm inclined towards because everyday is a new learning experience and hence you never know what cathes your attention next.</h4>

      <h4> I deal with a lot of transferable skills. One of my key skills include communication skills. I can be quite approachable without being biased. , I firmly believe that I have a strong and well-resolved decision-making capability. Before taking any decision, I cautiously analyze all the pros and cons of the situations possible. I also weigh the doubts and risks before coming to a decision. This thoughtful decision-making saves time and this is one of my key assets which I believe can make me stand out. Not to forget my problem-solving ability and the right amount of self-control. Amidst this lockdown, I've even trained myself in cooking and binge-watching. Yes, you heard it right, Binge-watching! I love to learn and grow and hence the right number of skills does not exist.</h4>
